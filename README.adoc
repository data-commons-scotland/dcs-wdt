= Waste Data Tool

This repository contains the source code and usage instructions for the Waste Data Tool (*WDT*).
The WDT provides functionality for:

* reading open data about waste in Scotland
* _re-working_ this data so that it is *easier* to use, understand, consume & parse
* writing the re-worked data as simple CSV and JSON files, to a single public repository.

The WDT is an output of the
https://www.stir.ac.uk/research/hub/contract/933675[Data Commons Scotland]
research project.

WARNING: This is software is very rough'n'ready - it is at a proof-of-concept level.

NOTE: Information about the mothballed Wikibase feature, can be found link:doc/wikibase.adoc[here].
