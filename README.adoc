= Waste Data Tool

This repository contains the source code and usage instructions for the Waste Data Tool (*WDT*).
The WDT provides functionality for reading and writing linked data about waste in Scotland,
against SPARQL and Wikibase services.

The WDT is an output of the
https://www.stir.ac.uk/research/hub/contract/933675[Data Commons Scotland]
research project.

WARNING: This is software is very rough'n'ready - it is at a proof-of-concept level.

== Outline

[source]
----
/* order datasets & dataset-aspects, most independent first */
for each dataset in [base, area, population, household-waste, co2e]
  for each dataset-aspect in [class-item, predicates, supporting-dimensions, measurements]
    for each record in the dataset-aspect
      if the record is not already represented in the Wikibase
        write-to-wikibase a property or item to represent the record
