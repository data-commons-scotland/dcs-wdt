  ;;; Simple cli4clj usage example:
  ;;; In the simplest scenario only the commands have to be defined.
  ;;; In the following, an example using a simple scenario along with some explanations is provided:
  ;;;              cli4clj is configured via an "options" map.
  ;;;              | Commands are stored in a nested map using the key :cmds in the options map.
  ;;;              |  |      As first simple example command, we define a command called "test-cmd".
  ;;;              |  |      |         The function to be called for the command is defined via :fn.
  ;;;              |  |      |         |  In this example we use an anonymous function.
  ;;;              |  |      |         |  However, arbitrary functions can be used.
  (cli/start-cli {:cmds {:test-cmd {:fn #(println "This is a test.")
                                    ;;;                                 Optionally a short information text can be given.
                                    :short-info "Test Command"
                                    ;;;                                 In addition, a long information text can be optionally given.
                                    :long-info "Prints a test message to stdout."
                                    ;;;                                 Furthermore, a "hint" text can be defined for the tab-completion.
                                    :completion-hint "This is a test command without arguments."

                         ;;;                      Just make sure that the alias refers to an existing command.

                         ;;;                      "h" is a pre-defined command but it can be overridden.
                         ;;;                      This is shown by using the definition of an alias to test as example.

                         ;;;                      The pre-defined "help" command, however, cannot be overridden.

                         ;;;                      The command is intended to take a seq (e.g., a list or vector) which it converts into a CSV string.
